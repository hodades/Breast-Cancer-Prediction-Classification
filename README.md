# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project focuses on predicting breast cancer using Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsy data. The dataset includes important features that aid in distinguishing between benign and malignant tumors. The workflow comprises data analysis, preprocessing, and model evaluation to ensure high prediction accuracy.

We explore multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the best model for classification. The models evaluated are:
- **Logistic Regression**: A baseline linear classifier suitable for binary classification.
- **Decision Tree**: A non-linear model that captures feature interactions.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: A distance-based approach considering nearest neighbors for prediction.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble model leveraging multiple decision trees.
- **XGBoost**: A boosting algorithm focused on improving weak models.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem.
- **Neural Network**: A deep learning model for complex pattern recognition.

After testing these algorithms, we compare their performance to identify the most effective approach for breast cancer classification.
